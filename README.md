# Mobile-Application-Pentesting (APK)

My personal Mobile App Pentesting Notes.

Currently this only contains resources/notes about Android applications (APK) 

Feel Free to dm me with any suggestions.

# Static Analysis

## Extract the Java code from the APK:
- ```apktool -s d test.apk```
  
## Hardcoded Secrets:

- https://github.com/alessandrodd/apk_api_key_extractor
- https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks
- https://github.com/m4ll0k/SecretFinder
- https://github.com/ndelphit/apkurlgrep

## Interesting findings:

- Firebase API
  - check https://example.firebaseio.com/.json
  - check for the hardcoded Firebase API Key
- Google Maps API Key
  - check if the API is misconfigured on https://googlekey.blindf.com/

## Janus vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156):
- This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into APK files without affecting the app's cryptographic signature
- This vulnerability could arise from only singing the APK with v1 or being installed on android API 23 > 

## Cryptographic Vulnerabilities:
- Pay attention to the use of Insecure hash algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1 which are known to have collisions.
- Search for Oracle padding attack which arises from multiple misconfigurations such as:
  - Use of RSA/ECB without padding
  - Encryption with CBC with PKCS5/PKCS7
